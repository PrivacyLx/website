QubesOS is an operating system unlike any other in terms of security. It it based on the idea of *security by compartmentalization*.

{{< tweet 781493632293605376 >}}

The presentation will be presented with the aim of solving some security issues investigative jounalists may face to provide empirical
examples on how it can be useful. But people from all backgrounds are invited.

Essentially instead of having on single computer where we have all of our passwords, browser history and documents while also opening random pdf and visiting every website,
QubesOS has many virtual machines, each for a different purpose which you decide. It is also made in such a way that if a virus is installed,
the next time you reboot that virtual machine will right back as it was before it was installed, but all your documents will be there still.

The talk will be an intro to the topic, but we would also like invite people who have already been using, as you might be able to learn something new or share what you know with the audience as well. All are welcome!
