TailsOS is an east to use operating system, designed for those who need additional
levels of privacy protection. It is used by *Journalists*, *Whistleblowers* and
some citizens who want to inscrase their privacy. To use it one one only needs a
computer and a USB stck. Once removed, it will leave no traces of its existence.

In  the workshop we'll install TailsOS on a USB Stick and use the system.
