Hello Privacy Enthusiast,

We have held many events and workshops to provide you with tools and know-how to claim back and improve your online privacy. However, this one is special. What if I were to tell you that a single USB stick can do all the job for you.

[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) is a live operating system that you can start on almost any computer from a USB stick or a DVD.

It aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity, and helps you to:
-use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship;
-leave no trace on the computer you are using unless you ask it explicitly;
-use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging."

This is a hands on workshop aimed for everyone but designed for non-technical people in mind.
All you need is :
1- your laptop (pls make sure it is fully charged or bring the charger)
2-A usb stick that has at least 8GB (we'll be bringing some spare ones, but they need to be returned at the end of the workshop)

We will spend the first 30 mins discussing and understanding the Tails Operating System. Rest of the 1.5 will be spent downloading and creating the live operating systems. 

Further questions or concerns regarding this event can be directed to cansuluna [at] protonmail.com
