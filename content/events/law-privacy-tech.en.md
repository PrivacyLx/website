Instead we will be welcoming Sara who is currently completing her research on GDPR at the University of Minho and Miguel who founded the project http://legis.lontra.pt/ during the Legal Hackathon ( https://legal-hackathon.com/ ).

Current and final schedule is as follows:

1. Introduction to basic concepts such as GDPR
