Want to know how your life is being regularly and consistently surveilled?
Understand the risks and learn how to protect yourself and your community.

Join us for an afternoon of discussions and hands-on activities to better
understand the world of mass surveillance, and to learn about basic tools you

the tools that will be discussed. During these workshops you will learn how to
reclaim your data and protect yourself in the age of mass surveillance.
