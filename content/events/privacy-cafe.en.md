At the privacy cafe, we'll have an informal gathering where we learn and teach each other on how we can better protect our privacy and our loved one's. There will be a 10 minute introduction to the topic and then we'll discuss the rest over beers and coffee.

**Bring your computer!** As We'll be talking about some practical tools you can use like the *tor browser*, *browser extentions* such as *firefox containers*, *password managers*, privacy respecting *operating systems*, how we can stop depending on google or facebook, but also other aspects that you might want to discuss.

Join us there!
