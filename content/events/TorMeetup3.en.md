Reclaiming your privacy on the internet may seem to be an overwhelming task. You aren't powerless, however. On the 23rd of February, we're holding a meetup in Lisboa, Portugal to talk about how Tor can help.

Join us to learn about how Tor works and how it can be used to enhance your personal privacy on the internet. We will discuss how Tor achieves a high degree of privacy for its users, how to use Tor Browser, and other uses of Tor for enhancing privacy. After this, we will answer questions you may have about Tor, Tor Browser, and other topics pertaining to privacy and anonymity on the internet. If time permits, we will also discuss how to run a Tor relay.

After that instroduction, we will do a workshop on setting up an onion service - a wesite or some other service which resides in and can only be accessed through the tor notwork, thus giving privacy to both the owner of the site and the users visiting it. Some examples of onion services are the New York Time's (https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/ - can only be accessed with the [tor browser](https://torproject.org)) or Privacy International's (https://privacyintyqcroe.onion/ - can only be accessed with the [tor browser](https://torproject.org))


At the end, for those interested in staying around we will configure a tor node at the venue.
