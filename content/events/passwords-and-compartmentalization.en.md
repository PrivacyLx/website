description: "We'll be exploring password security, how we can improve it as well as how to containerize our digital lives."

Just a week ago we saw possibly the biggest password leak - [773 million accounts](https://www.businessinsider.com/collection-one-data-breach-email-passwords-2019-1). Most certainly people around us were affected and possibly even us. We'll be diving into how we can make our passwords more secure and use compartmentalization to make sure that once personal logins leak in one service, it does not compormise the rest of our accounts.
