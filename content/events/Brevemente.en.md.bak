We would like to thank all the people who filled the rooms of our last events and let you know that we are preparing future events.

The newsletter signup is still a work in progress but we hope it won't take long. As soon as that is up, you will see on the homepage a signup from for that. That way we will be able to keep you updated on future events much more easily.

If you are interested in organizing events like the ones we've been doing or you are interested in colaborating in one, let us know at:

**francisco.core at protonmail.com** ou **kevin.gallagher at nyu.edu**.

Thanks and I hope to see you soon.
