Hello Privacy Enthusiast,

We are organising a picnic to discuss all things cryptography!!!
Where all your burning questions about hashing, encryption, keys and
more will be answered.  Or at least will be attempted :)

It will be a friendly, casual gathering meant for people with absolute
zero knowledge on cryptography. But everyone is welcome!

We aim to keep the picnic bi-lingual (PT & ENG)

**Date:** 4th July, 2020 \
**Time:** 2pm - 4pm \
**Place:** https://bbb.privacylx.org/b/fra-krg-6du (access code: 704298)
