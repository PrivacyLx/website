Hello Privacy Enthusiast,

We are organising a picnic to discuss all things cryptography!!!
Where all your burning questions about hashing, encryption, keys and
more will be answered.  Or at least will be attempted :)

It will be a friendly, casual gathering meant for people with absolute
zero knowledge on cryptography. But everyone is welcome!

We will be gathering at Jardim Estrella on June 27 at 2pm
We aim to keep the picnic bi-lingual (PT & ENG)

**!!!Bringing a mask is mandatory!!!** **We will be following the
rules and regulations following the pandemic for the safety of all of
us.** If we're a big group (not likely) we'll have to split into
smaller ones.

Bringing food, drinks, beach towels to sit on the grass… is voluntary

**Registration:** recommended (but non-mandatory) - just send an email to cansuluna[at]protonmail.com saying you'll come \
**Date:** 27th july, 2020 \
**Time:** 14:00 - 16:00 \
**Place:** Jardim da Estrela (in front of [estatue Pedro Álvares Cabral](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/38.71572/-9.15871))
