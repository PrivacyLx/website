Organizing a Privacy Café is challenging and rewarding work. Read the following information carefully and remember: you do not have to do everything alone. A Privacy Café is ideally carried by different people. This increases quality, lowers the workload and makes organizing a Café more fun.

1. Prick a date
Everything talks a lot easier if you have a concrete date in your head. Keep in mind your target group and other volunteers.

2. Select a location

A Privacy Café needs outlets and an internet connection, tea, coffee and biscuits. (View here the checklist "What should be present at the location".) We think it is important that a Privacy Café is always accessible free of charge. Privacy Cafes are often organized at libraries, or in youth and community centers. But in fact every public place can house a Privacy Café. In addition to the location, think of other partners, such as a local hackerspace, medialab or community center.

3. Create a team

  You never only organize a Privacy Café. There are different ways to find volunteers who can help you. We encourage you to try them all.

  Let everyone in your area know that you are going to organize a Privacy Café and are in need of help. You do not only need people who want to help visitors, but maybe someone wants to make photos, people can continue the question in their own network, or a friend or girlfriend likes to write a report of the afternoon.

  Ask the location if they can place a call for volunteers on their website / in their newsletter. Or maybe you can hang up a poster or a note on location indicating that help is being sought.

  Send an email to the volunteer mailing list of the Privacy Café.

4. Communicate

Place a poster and flyers at the location

Use our pre-fab press release to notify the local press a week in advance of the event and invite them to be present
Make sure you spread your appeal among a diverse audience. After all, that is the purpose of the Privacy Café. Work together with the partners so that you not only reach your own acquaintances: preaching for your own parish is a waste of everyone's time.
Ask the location to send a press release, and write a piece for her website.
Provide at least one month in advance what the plans are, then we ensure that the event is placed in the Privacy Café agenda.
Provide a good photographer and blogger, then you can log on to the Privacy Café site after the event about how it went. For future editions it is good to have a lot of documentation. Explain to those present why you are taking photos and give them the opportunity to indicate if they do not want to display.
