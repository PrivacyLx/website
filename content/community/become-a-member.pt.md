## Bilingual community

We are a bilingual communinty. We'll try to accommodate both English

languages we'll try to whisper translate. In that case, please ask for
help and it will be provided.

## Process for becoming a member

In our association we make it so everyone gets to vote on everything
(as a grassroots organization). And also because we want to make sure
everyone has a greate time, we have a bit of a selection process.

But it's supper easy to go though as long as you show you care about
privacy and either have been around in some events and talked to
people or have been involved in other privacy communities. It goes as
follows:

1. Find someone from the association (or be invited) who's willing to
   vouch for you to become a member. Let's call her/him the supporting
   member.

2. Give the supporting member the following info: (via email or something):
   1. Name by which you wanna be refered to
   2. List of privacy-related activities you've been involved recently
   3. Email address by which you'd like to get contacted for association-related communications
   
3. Your supporing memeber will propose to the other members your
   application (along with the info you gave) and after two weeks
   we'll have a concensus.

4. If you're accepted, welcome! You are now officially a member and
   can now pay the member fees (you have 90 days for that but only get
   to vote after those are payed)

5. If your application was denied, we'll get back to you with an
   explanation of why that is and recommendations on how to get
   accepted.

## Rights and obligations

Member's rights are explaied in the bylaws and in the internal
regulation. That will be be made available to you if you express
interest in becoming a member.
