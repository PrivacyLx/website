We are a non-profit association (officially Defend our Privacy
Association, NIPC 515584550) and we *want your help to defend
privacy*.
&nbsp;

#### Our mission

> We are a non-profit association focused on the defense of the
digital privacy and security as fundamental rights for a
free society through education, research and development of
tools for safeguarding them.* &nbsp; <a style="color:

515584550)</a> &nbsp;

#### Why join?

We organize events open to the general public or particular audiences
where we teach the theory and practice of privacy and digital security
through [workshops](/events/), [Privacy Cafés](/events/privacy-cafe-mill-feb2020/), [blogs](/post/),
discussions in our [forum](https://cafe.privacylx.org/) and [online
presentations](/resources/). *All this organized by members on their
own time and on a voluntary basis.*

We are an association of varied skills and abilities. It is not needed
to know technology, programming, digital security or related issues.
**Only the interest in promoting privacy as a Human Right.**

* ##### **Make your voice heard**

    Above all, we are a democratic-based organization, made up of
    individuals passionate about the subject. This means that all
    decisions taken in the association are made with the following in mind
    next rule: all decided collectively. Each person in the
    association has a say in the measures we take,
    including decisions about events, funding, strategy, and
    a lot more.

    Quotas are essential to support the organisation, to carry out
    workshops and other events for the general public
