Hey, Welcome to PrivacyLx!

This is the welcome pack and it will go over the basic stuff of how the
organization works who does what and how can you help.

## What is PrivacyLx about?

The association aims to defend **digital privacy** and **digital security** as
fundamental rights for a free society through **education**, **research and
development** of tools and service for its protection. You can find more about
us [here](https://privacylx.org/en/about/about-us).

Currently we're most active in [organizing events](https://privacylx.org/events/)
and creating [educational material](https://privacylx.org/resources/).
Furthermore we are creating campaigns and compiled a list of ideas that with a
bit more collaboration can be brought to life. You can find more about this by
looking at the [action category](https://cafe.privacylx.org/c/action/5) of our
forum.

## How can I help?

We always need help, read through this section to find out how you can help us.
Also do not hesitate to ask us if you can help us in other such as providing us
with a physical space, or a server that we can use, etc.

*Help is always appreciated.*

### Events

If you have a special skill, interested in a specific topic, want to host an
event or simply propose something, feel free to present your idea or have a look
on other ideas by visiting this
[section of our forum](https://cafe.privacylx.org/c/action/5).

You are always welcome to join us to the [events](https://privacylx.org/events/)
too, of course!

We are in need of a physical space in Lisbon, please contact us if you can offer
us a space that we can occasionally use to make events and work together.

### Community

We're a community of people that dearly care about a cause. By being an active
and welcoming member you make the community's heart beat.
[The forum](https://cafe.privacylx.org) is our main virtual home. For sure
you'll find here many are interesting conversations and you're very much welcome
to participate.

If you have questions about anything, you may contact the moderators at our
[forum](https://cafe.privacylx.org), just message `@moderators` or send an email
to: `contact at privacylx.org`

### Educational Materials

We've been publishing a series of slides that we've used throughout [our
presentations](https://privacylx.org/resources/). Feel free to propose any other
material that you may find useful in either Portuguese or English. The best
place to do so is the [learning category](https://cafe.privacylx.org/c/learn/13)
of the forum.

### Research

There are always research ideas and proposals, please have a look at the
following sections of the forum to get started:

- [Action category](https://cafe.privacylx.org/c/action/5)
- [Discuss category](https://cafe.privacylx.org/c/discuss-privacy/15)

### Development

Do you have a call project or idea that you would like to develop then please
talk to us. Also if you would like to help improve our code in the services we
are using please have a look at our
[open issues](https://github.com/PrivacyLx/privacylx-issue-tracker/issues).

### Infrastructure

We self-host our infrastructure. We use software that automates the deployment,
configuration and managements of our infrastructure and all our code and
deployment tools can be found in our
[git repository](https://github.com/PrivacyLx/devops). Currently we host a
[website](http://privacylx.org), our [forum](https://cafe.privacylx.org/),
our mailserver and [BigBlueButton](https://bbb.privacylx.org). If you have
knowledge of system administration or would like to learn don't hesitate to have
a look at our configurations and open issues in our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/privacylx/privacylx-issue-tracker).

We are in need of a physical server or server collocation to a datacenter in
Portugal that we can host a Tor relay exit node, please contact us if you can
help us with that.

### Other

that we need help with. Furthermore you can help us to improve our
