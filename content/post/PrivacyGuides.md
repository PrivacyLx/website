On this post, I want to link to as many privacy guides as I possibly can. I will
try to add more as I find them.

* https://tacticaltech.org/themes/digital-security/
* https://privacytools.io
* [Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/) | Tips, Tools and How-tos for Safer Online Communications
* [An In-Depth Guide to Choosing a VPN](https://freedom.press/training/choosing-a-vpn/)
* [Software alternatives](https://prism-break.org/en/)


This really great medium post does a very great overview of these guides:
