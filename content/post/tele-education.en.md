you need to do is to reach out to us via contact [at] privacylx.org

**Today we sent the following letter to the Portuguese Ministry of Education:**

Dear Ministry of Education,

Regarding the topic of tele-education, the PrivacyLx association (NIPC
515584550) is ready to voluntarily provide their know-how and consulting for the
installation and setup of a pilot tele-education platform based on the education
platform [Moodle][1] and the audio-video teleconference system
of [BigBlueButton][2]. These systems have already been
deployed and used by many universities, schools and other institutions from all
over the world with very positive experiences.

We are an organization that defends the right to privacy and we believe we can
contribute to the protection of students' privacy.

We are very well aware that commercially centralized services are not
appropriate, pose critical privacy and security issues and in many cases cannot
handle the network throughput that during the pandemic has been increased
immensely.

Despite the [legal guidance of the CNPD][3]
we find that there is still no general guidance of a technical guideline and
each school adopts its solution, following rules that are often questionable,
which have consequences for the safety and privacy of students, parents and
teachers.

A success case of one of these platforms, has been referenced by the [European
Union Free Software Observatory][4].

Unfortunately, the current pandemic situation will extend over a long period of
time, and in the long term it will be necessary to implement a safe and reliable
system aimed at the education of the Portuguese education.

We are at your disposal for any questions or in further clarifications regarding
the details of the proposed systems.
