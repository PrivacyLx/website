Dear **PrivacyLx**ers,

Instead of our weekly meetings we'll be organizing a monthly community discussion online in our chat.

Would you like to bring a topic for discussion? Are you concerned with your
digital footprint or/and want to protect your privacy online (and offline)?

Then you have a good reason to join us on our weekly gathering, where we will be
having lively discussions and Q&A on security, privacy, anonymity and freedom of
expression online.

Join us every first wednesday of the month at 19:00h (Lisbon time). 

Save the date and join us!
