Concerned about Zoom platform safety issues, the PrivacyLx (Defend our
Privacy Association) shares the content of the email sent to the
National Center for Cyber Security on the 15th May 2020 given no
clarification or reply was given up to the date of publication.

Bellow is an English translation of the orignal email.

Dear Centro Nacional de Cibersegurança,

The unexpected outbreak of COVID-19, which spread in the form of a
pandemic and led us to social confinement and teleworking, led us to
look for solutions to maintain relations and communications with the
outside world, including videoconferencing platforms. This is the
scope that brought the growing adoption of the Zoom platform, raising
serious concerns around Security and Privacy.

Concerned about security and privacy issues of video conferencing
platforms, the PrivacyLx association (Defend our Privacy Association,
NIPC 515584550) shows a certain apprehension with the inclusion of
Zoom platform in the list of good practices (1) published on the
V. website.

We are aware of the good intention of the National Center for Cyber
Security, since the universe of users is wide and, being this the
reality, they should do it in the safest way. However, we are
concerned that the adoption of such measures transmits the feeling of
security, even if false, namely:

- the poor quality of encryption (2) and misleading advertising concerning the type of security (3); 

- by alleged development practices similar to malware (4) (5)

- include undesirable and vulnerable user features (6); 

- the existence of zero-days from the last few months that have not been properly reported as CVEs.

In addition, the lack of respect for privacy is evident in the various examples, such as:

- the sharing of personal data with third parties without the user's knowledge (7); 

- the disproportion of data obtained from the user, such as attention monitoring (8) and click control (9).

We therefore share the concerns that have led several US entities to
disapprove of the Zoom platform, such as: the Senate (10), the
Department of Defense (11), the FBI (12), New York educational
institutions (13) and the shareholders themselves - with accusations
of fraud (14) and lawsuits (15); and as such, we believe that citizens
should be assertively informed (16).

Concluding, we propose to discourage the Zoom platform and as an
alternative the use of jitsi (17), Big Blue Button (open source
software) (18) easily integrated with moodle (19) which is already
correctly recommended in the list of good practices (1).


Sincerely,

(PrivacyLx)
