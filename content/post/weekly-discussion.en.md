Dear **PrivacyLx**ers,

Weâ€™ll be trying out a weekly community discussion online in our chat.

Would you like to bring a topic for discussion?, are you concerned with your
digital footprint or/and want to protect your privacy online (and offline)?

Then you have a good reason to join us on our weekly gathering, where we will be
having lively discussions and Q&A on security, privacy, anonymity and freedom of
expression online.

The first gathering will take place on **Wednesday, 11 November, 2020**.
Save the date and join us!
