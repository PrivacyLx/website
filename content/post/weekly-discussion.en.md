Dear **PrivacyLx**ers,

Weâ€™ll be trying out a weekly community discussion online in our chat.

Would you like to bring a topic for discussion? Are you concerned with your
digital footprint or/and want to protect your privacy online (and offline)?

Then you have a good reason to join us on our weekly gathering, where we will be
having lively discussions and Q&A on security, privacy, anonymity and freedom of
expression online.

Join us every wednesday at 19:00h (Lisbon time). The first gathering will take place this **Wednesday, 11 November, 2020**.

Save the date and join us!
