How not to contribute to the loss of privacy by our friends and family.

Privacy is about choice. You do you and chose whatever level of privacy you see fit to your need, but we cannot make that choice for others. When we share a picture, for example, we should think if the other person would agree with it. We’ll talk about issues like these and think collectively how we can solve these problems

Given in the context of the series of events "0xCFD0 - Ciclo Cifra-te ou Devoram-te @Disgraça" by Vasilis Ververis.
